Specific rules
first normal form
using row to convey information is not permitted
mixing data types is not permitted
having a table without a primary key is not permitted
repeating groups is not permitted

second normal form
only dependant non key attributes of the entire primary key should be part of a table. Anything else should be in its own table.
For viewing together, we would join on the relation.

(third normal form) boyce codd normal form
every (non key) attribute in a table should depend on the key, the whole key and nothing but the key. This specifically negates transitive dependency

normalised tables have one version of the truth and are protected from anything else

first, second, third etc normal form

be explicit. If ordering on something, show what that is
Don't mix data types in a column
table without primary key violates the first form of normalisation

storing a repeating group of data in a single row violates from 1
